# Star_Wars_Survey
Star Wars Survey - A project on data cleaning and EDA <br>
While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?
<br>
The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. The responses can be downloaded from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).
<br>
In this project we will attempt to answer 4 main questions: <br>
1. Which is the most viewed movie among Star Wars episodes 1 through 6? <br>
2. Which is the audience favorite movie among Star Wars episodes 1 through 6? <br> 
3. Which character is the audience favorite? Who is the least favorite and who is the most unfamiliar? <br>
4. How do the responses to questions (1) and (2) vary between Star Trek & Non Star Trek fans? <br>
